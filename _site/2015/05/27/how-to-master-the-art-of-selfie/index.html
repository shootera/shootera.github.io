  <p>If you are living in  generation of smartphones users or more apparently using one then we are quite sure you must have heard the term <em>“Selfie”</em> and even taken a few for that matter. </p>

<p>We are surrounded by selfies, and by that we don’t mean they are living and walking with us, rather our social media is so full of them and we all admit that some selfies could really annoy us!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selfie : The concept of taking photos of self using a handheld device, primarily for social networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So lets promise not to annoy our followers and loose count over hard earned and showed off followers over social networks. Let’s pledge to take out 5 minutes and read what is the need of the hour, <em><strong>“Mastering the art of selfies”.</strong></em> </p>

<h3 id="let-there-be-light">Let there be light</h3>
<p>Use natural light. Stand near a window as this will give your selfie a soft and natural look. Step outside,early mornings or late afternoons are theperfect time for lighting. This will also help in reducing the dark shadows and would not make your Facebook friends think that you party till late.</p>

<h3 id="the-machocute-side-and-the-bad-angles">The macho/cute side and the bad angles</h3>
<p>Oh, the best thing about being your own photographer is you can bring up your best side and hide the the less flattering side and the trick that works the best to make your face look slimmer is to shoot your selfie from slightly above. For that double chin, stick out your neck just a little. Also for that torso, turn one shoulder slightly towards the camera and start counting the likes once its uploaded ;)</p>

<h3 id="filters-filters-filters">Filters! Filters! Filters!</h3>
<p>If you are using a smart phone then use the filters in instagram or other editing tools and do complete justice to your selfie. These filters can really really brighten you up and could make you look cool the way you were trying to, when the shutter just fired!</p>

<h3 id="why-so-serious-lets-put-a-smile-on-that-face-as-joker-say">Why so serious? Let’s put a smile on that face (as joker say)</h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong in taking your life seriously, but why a selfie, what has that few kb’s of photo done to you, why take it so seriously! And the base line is those serious looking angry young men kind of selfies are really annoying. Your selfie radiates coolness, like you were just out and about and it suddenly occurred to you to turn the camera around and grab photo of yourself, which of course turned out to be awesome offcourse.</p>

<h3 id="more-the-merrier">More the merrier</h3>
<p>C’mon this could be your new profile picture or an instagram update, you have all the right in the world to have a number of options. So don’t be afraid and take tons of pictures to choose from and remember even the most effortless-looking selfies took time and options.</p>

<p><strong>What are you waiting for? Step out, have fun and keep clicking!</strong></p>
