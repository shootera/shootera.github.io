A beautiful sunrise or sunset is the most amazing landscape to do justice with your camera. The first and the foremost Setting you need to do is changing the white balance of your camera to daylight from automatic.

### Setting up your camera right

1. Set the focus to manual, focus by hand and keep the camera still.

2. If available use a tripod, and view your composition in it.

3. Switch to manual exposure.

4. Expose for the sun and the sky, and then move to your subject as underexposure gives richer colors.

### Aiming for a perfect composition

1. Make sure that you have enough time to check and test for various compositons before the climax!

2. Look for clouds. Blank skies will often give less interesting sunrises or sunsets because there is nothing for the light from the rising or setting sun to illuminate.

3. Watch the Horizon. Don’t put it in the middle of the photo. As the ground is usually dark so you end up with a photo that is half black, use the sensor completely and capture the glorious sky.

4. Look for silhouettes. Get down low to put some flowers in the composition, find a tree or a tree branch and it to your frame which would work as a silhouette. Remember not to put these things in the middle of the picture, they are best suited at bottoms, corners or sides.

5. Keep Shooting before and after sunset. As the color of the sky keeps changing and you can never predict it. You never know when the best shot will occur.

6. Turn around. Sometimes the best picture is just behind you, lit by the golden color of the sunrise or sunset.
 
 
### Some words of wisdom

1. As there is too much contrast for your camera to capture, you will either end up with detail in the sky and a dark foreground, or detail in the foreground and an overexposed sky. If you choose an exposure so that the foreground is slightly dark, and shoot in raw mode, you can recover much of the shadow detail when you process the image.

2. You should also make sure that the shutter speed set by the camera is fast enough for you to hand hold the camera steady enough to avoid camera shake. If the shutter speed drops below 1/30sec then you’ll need to put the camera on a tripod, or increase the ISO setting to 200 or 400.

3. Zoom in all the way or use your strongest telephoto lens and start looking around the sunrise or sunset along the horizon (Do not stare into the sun through your camera, as this can damage your eyes. You may use Live View with your camera, and stare at the sun on your LCD). You will often find amazing color and tonalities

**Have fun with shooting the sunrise and the sunset!**
